Module One Final Project - Sarcasm Search and Weather Locator 
=============================================================

## General Description 
===================

Flatiron full stack web developer module one requires a final individual that demonstrates the following objectives 

Through Ruby use: 
- Object Orientation
- Relationships (via ActiveRecord)
- Problem Solving (via creating a Command Line Interface (CLI)) 

For more information regarding requirements, please refer below to the Goals section. 

Sarcasm search and weather locator is my first functioning composition. This was a huge leap for me as the most I had ever written was smaller functions through the prep work which I started two months prior. With very little exposure to logic, using github, or anything else in this environment, I implimented a fundamental demonstration of the basics of Ruby, object orientation, relationship structures using ActiveRecord and problem solving abilities. 

Please enjoy utitlizing my CLI app to demonstrate these key concepts. 

As always, this is live code and from time to time as my knowledge expands, I will return back to refactor my first project. 


## Download Instructions
=====================

Please include the following gems:

- bundle install 
- gem install colorize

Please run file out of terminal with the command line:    rake cli

This will initiate the program and the first screen you should see is to type in your name. 
After entering in your name, you will be taken to a menu option screen which should allow you to search weather, view, delete and modify existing search records associated with weather with a pinch of sarcasm thrown in for good measure.  

## Goals (Minimum Requirements)
===============================

You will be building a **Command Line CRUD App** that uses a database to persist information. The goal of which is to demonstrate all of the skills that you've learned in module one:

- Ruby
- Object Orientation
- Relationships (via ActiveRecord)
- Problem Solving (via creating a Command Line Interface (CLI))

Your **minimum requirements** for this project are to build a Command Line App that:

1. Contains at least three models with corresponding tables, including a join table.
2. Accesses a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord.
3. Has a CLI that allows users to interact with your database as defined by your _user stories_ (minimum of four; one for each CRUD action).
4. Uses good OO design patterns. You should have separate models for your runner and CLI interface.
